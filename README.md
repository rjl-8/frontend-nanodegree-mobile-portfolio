## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

Changes made to improve performance
1. Moved the contents of style.css and print.css files to inline style tags
2. Refactored the 2 of the least efficient images sizewise (img/profilepic.jpg and views/images/pizzeria.jpg) to compress their size.  I created new files (*.min.jpg) so I also changed the references to the image files in the index.html and the pizza.html files respectively.
3. Made the call to google-analytics javascript library asynchronous
4. Minified the performance.js file to performance.min.js and changed the references to point to the new filename

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

Changes made to improve performance
1. Scrolling: in updatePositions function, I moved the scrollTop calculation out of the loop through all the floating pizza images
2. Pizza size toggle: in changePizzaSizes function:
  * cleaned up multiple calls to querySelectorAll in loop through all the pizzas
  * dropped the use of the determineDx function and instead stole the sizeSwitcher function from determineDX to return a fixed percent to avoid all the unnecessary calculation the provided function used.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
